# Plotly Challenge
Andrew Anastasiades | @andrew-ana

### Summary
This mini-project shows how we can use plotly to quickly assemble analytics dashboards that are responsive to user controls.  
I tried to play around with some of the colors (converting OTU ids to a hex value) but ultimately decided against it. Hex conversion pushes the colors further apart than the default plotly color mechanism (which I believe linearizes the colors). The benefits over static matplotlib graphics are inumerable, but the perhaps the most obvious one is responsiveness. Furthermore, I like how FAST javascript operates in the browser. It's actually shocking how quickly we can manipulate the dom and handle (somewhat) large datasets.  
Anyway, I hope you enjoy my little dashboard!
